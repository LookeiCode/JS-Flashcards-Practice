Check back for updates and simply do a "git pull" to pull in the latest changes

# NOTES
There will be no outright explanations. Refer to the documentation. It's good practice to refer to the documentation and I want to reinforce that.

This repo is purely syntax. You should be able to figure it out after looking at it for a few minutes as I kept it very short and simple. If you're confused refer to the MDN and CAREFULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION and also review the syntax.

Once you feel you can understand the code use the flashcards to challenge your knowledge.

# CHALK
If you want to use colors in your console like I did this is the repo for CHALK!

It's very cool and useful for highlighting things or even debugging!
