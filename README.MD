# NOTES
There will be almost no explanations. Refer to the documentation. It's good practice to refer to the documentation and I want to reinforce that.

However, SOMETIMES I will give a explanation if I feel something is outside the scope of the official documentation and because I want to create my own documentation to reinforce key points to accelerate learning and comprehension.
If I provide no explanation of my own that means I feel the official documentation should suffice.

This repo is mostly syntax. You should be able to figure it out after looking at it for a few minutes as I kept it very short and simple. If you're confused refer to the MDN and CAREFULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION and also review the syntax.

Once you feel you can understand the code use the flashcards to challenge your knowledge.

# CHALK
If you want to use colors in your console like I did this is the repo for CHALK!

It's very cool and useful for highlighting things or even debugging!
