# NOTES
There will be no outright explanations. Refer to the documentation. It's good practice to refer to the documentation and I ant to reinforce that.

This repo is purely syntax. You should be able to figure it out after looking at it for a few minutes as I kept it very short and simple. If you're confused refer to the MDN and CAREFULLY READ THE DESCRIPTION and also review the syntax.

Once you feel you can understand the code use the flashcards to challenge your knowledge.
